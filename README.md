    * Briefly explain the work that you did on this project: What code were you given? What code did you create yourself?
    
    For Project 2, I wrote the code within the main loop of the application. This code allowed the agent to decide the action strategy
    (exploration or exploitation).     
    
    * Connect your learning from throughout this course to the larger field of computer science:
        * How do I approach a problem as a computer scientist?
        
        As with most problems I try to formulate a hypothesis and then try to disprove or prove. In CS this often takes the form of an algorithm.
        
        * What are my ethical responsibilities to the end user and the organization?
        
        I think my ethical responsibilities to the end user lie in the realm of transperency. As far as ML goes, this transparency might look like
        examining biases and publishing the sources of data used for training.
